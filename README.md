A-

## Note for This Class
1. This class is a pure math class, an extension of the undergraduate probability theory course. Because I forgot a lot of my undergraduate calculus and probability theory, the second half of the course (such as Markov stochastic processes) was difficult for me.
2. All grades for this class are from exams and quizzes, and there are no homework. The quizzes are bi-weekly and if you know probability theory well, this class will be perfect for you (I usually spend about 6-10 hours reviewing what I've learned over the two weeks before the quiz)
3. I think the questions in the textbook used in the course are a little too difficult, the questions in the quiz are usually not that difficult, but like I said earlier, the latter content is a bit more difficult
4. Because the quiz and the quiz solutions may offend the professor's teaching, I have removed these two sections.

## Note

2. If you are Professor/TA for this class and think my content violates your teaching, please email me with a proof of your identity at xiji6874@colorado.edu. I will delete it for you.
3. Please **DO NOT** email me with questions about my/your assignemnts, you should finish your work by yourself. I won't reply to those emails. (The only reason you're emailing me should be that some of my content violates your course content).
4. Some parts of the assignment may be wrong because I don't remember each assignment grades, so I put my grades for this course for your reference. Again please just have it for inspiration and **DO NOT** use it for plagiarism.
5. The predecessors planted trees, and the later generations enjoyed the shade. I also got a lot of inspiration from other people's repo in the process of learning, so I uploaded my course material, I hope these content will help you.
